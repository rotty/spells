;;; @subsection Individual file operations

;;@defun file-exists? pathname
;;
;; Returns true if a file or directory exists on the file system at a
;; location specified by @var{pathname}.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun create-directory pathname
;;
;; Creates a new directory at @var{pathname}. It is an error if there
;; already exists an object at the location designated by
;; @var{pathname}.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun delete-file pathname
;;
;; Deletes the object on the file system at the location specified by
;; @var{pathname} (be it a regular file, a directory, or anything
;; else).  If there is no such object, nothing is done.  It is an
;; error if @var{pathname} designates a directory that is not empty or
;; the operating system does not permit its deletion by the Scheme
;; program.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun rename-file old-pathname new-pathname
;;
;; Renames or moves the file specified by @var{old-pathname} to
;; @var{new-pathname}. @var{new-pathname} may be a file pathname, in
;; which case the file is given that exact name; it may also be a
;; directory pathname, in which case the file is moved into that
;; directory.  The object on the file system specified by
;; @var{old-pathname} may be any kind of file: regular, directory, &c.
;; It is an error if the Scheme program is not permitted by the
;; operating system to perform this operation, @var{old-pathname} does
;; not exist, or @var{new-pathname} designates a file that is not in a
;; directory that already exists and in which files are allowed by the
;; operating system to be created by the Scheme program.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun file-regular? pathname
;;@defunx file-symbolic-link? pathname
;;@defunx file-directory? pathname
;;@defunx file-readable? pathname
;;@defunx file-writable? pathname
;;
;; These all test various attributes of the file specified by
;; @var{pathname}.  @code{file-regular?} tests whether the file is a
;; regular file, rather than a directory or other kind of object on
;; the file system; @code{file-directory?}  tests whether the file is
;; a directory; @code{file-readable?} tests whether the file can be
;; read by the Scheme program, i.e. opening an input port over it will
;; not fail; and @code{file-writable?} tests whether a file specified
;; by @var{pathname} could be written to, i.e. opening an output port
;; to it would not fail.
;;
;; @code{file-regular?} and @code{file-directory?} return false if
;; there is no object on the file system designated by @var{pathname}.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun file-modification-time pathname
;;
;; Returns a SRFI 19 time object that represents the last time that
;; the file on the file system at the location specified by
;; @var{pathname} was modified or the time that it was created.  It is
;; an error if the operating system does not allow the Scheme program
;; to access this attribute of the file or the file does not already
;; exist.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun file-size-in-bytes pathname
;;
;; Returns the number of bytes that the regular file designated by
;; @var{pathname} contains.  The effect is unspecified if
;; @var{pathname} is not a regular file.  It is an error if the file
;; does not already exist or the Scheme program is not permitted by
;; the operating system to probe this attribute of the file.

;;;@subsection Directory content operations
;;
;; The operations in this section deal with directory contents.

;;;@subsubheading Primitives
;;
;; These are the procedures that the rest of directory content
;; operations are built upon; you might want to consider using the
;; foof-loop operators instead, which provide a more convenient
;; interface. 

;;@defun directory-stream? object
;; Return @code{#t} if @var{object} is a directory stream, @code{#f}
;; otherwise.
;;@end defun

;;@defun open-directory-stream pathname
;;
;; Open the directory specified by @var{pathname} for reading its
;; contents.  Returns a directory stream.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun close-directory-stream stream
;;
;; Close the directory stream @var{stream}, freeing associated
;; resources.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@defun read-directory-stream stream
;;
;; Read an entry from @var{stream}.
;;
;;@end defun

;;@subsubheading Foof-loop integration
;;
;; Foof-loop is an extensible loop facility that allows for concise
;; and convenient expression of complex loops. The iterators described
;; in the following extend foof-loop to allow for iteration over
;; directory contents.  @xref{Top,,the foof-loop documentation,(wak
;; foof-loop)}, for more information about how to use foof-loop.

;; @math{N} is the number of seeds: a boolean that, if true, specifies
;; that the iteration should continue, or, if false, specifies that

;; the iteration is halted, either because @var{combiner} returned
;; @code{#f} as its first value or because there are no more files in
;; the directory, the current set of state seeds is returned.  There
;; is no reliable ordering of the filenames passed to @var{combiner}.

;; @lisp
;;  (define (directory-fold pathname combiner . seeds)
;;    (apply
;;      directory-fold* pathname
;;      (lambda (dir-entry . seeds)

;;
;; Some of the above examples are simplified by DIRECTORY-FOLD; e.g.,

;; directory, one can use:
;;
;; @lisp
;;   (directory-fold directory cons '())
;; @end lisp

;; This is like @code{directory-fold}, but it walks down entire trees
;; of directories.  For each entry in the directory named by @1: if
;; that entry is a non-directory, @var{combiner} is passed the full pathname of
;; that file and the current seeds, and the walk of the directory's
;; entries proceeds with the new seeds; if that entry is a directory,
;; @3 is passed the full pathname of that directory & the current
;; seeds, and the seeds it returns are used to recursively descend
;; into the directory.  When the recursive descent returns, the seeds
;; it returned are used to proceed the walk of the enclosing
;; directory's entries.  This could be defined as follows:
;;
;; @lisp
;;   (define (directory-fold-tree pathname file-combiner dir-combiner
;;                                . seeds)
