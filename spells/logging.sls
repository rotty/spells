;; @subheading Introduction
;;
;; This library is heavily inspired by Python's
;; @uref{http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html,logging
;; module}. The main concepts involved are:
;;
;; @table @emph
;;
;; @item Log levels
;;
;; Each item to be logged is issued at a specific log level, which is
;; a numeric value that designates is significance. The library
;; provides convinient ways to filter out items below a certain
;; threshold.
;;
;; @item Log entries
;; A log entry is an object encapsulating a reference to the logger
;; (see below) where it originated, a log level, the time when issued, and the
;; item to be logged, an application-defined object.
;;
;; @item Log handlers
;;
;; A log handler is a single-argument procedure that is
;; responsible for somehow "presenting" the log message, which may
;; involve arbitary action, for example sending it over the network to
;; some log host.
;;
;; @item Loggers
;;
;; Loggers consult a threshold and a list of filters to decide whether
;; to process a log entry that is handed to them. Matching log entries
;; are then delegated to log handler procedures, each of which is
;; again guarded by a threshold and a list of filters.
;;
;; Each logger has name in a hierarchical namespace; therefore, each
;; logger, except for the root logger, has a parent, which it will
;; pass log entries to if propagation is enabled for that logger.
;;
;; @end table
;;
;; Loggers are intended to be the static part of the logging system in
;; your application: typically, you will define one for each part of
;; the application you want to be able to differentiate with regards
;; to logging. Their associated handlers, the thresholds and filters,
;; need not be static to the code or a single run of the application,
;; making it possible to change logging behaviour mid-run, which is
;; useful especially for long-running processes.

;;@ Set the properties of @var{logger} according to the alist
;; @var{properties}, which may contain the following keys:
;;
;; @table @code
;; @item handlers
;;
;; A list of handlers specifications. Each item in this list may
;; either be a procedure, or a list of one of these forms:
;;
;; @table @code
;; @item (@var{threshold} @var{handler})
;; @item (@var{threshold} (@var{filter} ...) @var{handler})
;; @item (@var{handler})
;; @end table
;;
;; Each @var{handler} and @var{filter} may be either a procedure of
;; the appropriate type, or a symbol, referencing a (procedure) value
;; in the alist @var{procedures}. It may also be a list of the form
;; @code{(@var{name} . @var{args})}, which is interpreted by looking
;; up @var{name} in @var{procedures}, and applying the resulting
;; procedure to @var{args}, the result from that application is used
;; for the corresponding handler or filter procedure. This simple
;; lookup facility is provided so that applications can use a value
;; taken from a configuration file for @var{properties}, and supply
;; the necessary handlers and filters (or their constructors)
;; statically via @var{procedures}.
;;
;; If either of these keys is not present, the empty list is used as
;; default.
;;
;; @item threshold
;; A logging level, or @code{#f}. All entries with levels below (using @code{<}
;; as comparison procedure) the threshold will be discarded (@code{#f}, which is
;; the default, is considered to be negative infinity, hence allowing all entries
;; to pass).
;; @item propagate?
;; Whether to propage the message to parent handlers. Defaults to @code{#t}.
;; @end table
;;
;; The values for both @code{threshold} and @code{propagate?} are
;; expected to be in the second (i.e. @code{cadr} position) of the
;; corresponding entry, so you don't have to, and must not, use dots
;; to force a single cons cell.
;;
;; If @var{properties} is not specified, a default value is used,
;; which contains just a @code{handler} list with a single handler,
;; without threshold and filters, using @ref{default-log-formatter} to
;; format the log entry.
